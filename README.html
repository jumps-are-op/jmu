<h1>Jmu  <i>Jumps' MarkUp language</i></h1>
<p>All markup languages are overcomplicated and bloated.</br>
Jmu is a minimalist, expandable, and usable markup language.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>I was making my <a href="https://jumps-are-op.github.io">webpage</a>
and I needed to choose a markup language, the obvious choice was <code>markdown</code>
I already know some markdown and I started with it.</br>
The more and more I use it I realize it's a <i><ins>bare bone</ins></i> language,
And every program have their own "flavors",
and these "flavors" are incompatible with each other.</br>
Then I started using <code>AsciiDoc</code>, which is a <b>BLOATED</b> markup language,
and I can't even use it,
<code>AsciiDoctor</code> (<i>most famous implementation</i>) uses ruby gems
which contains non-free packages and is <b>PROPRIETARY</b>.</br>
I use Parabola GNU/Linux-libre (<i>Arch Linux without non-free software</i>)
I only use 100% free software, I will <ins>NEVER</ins> install any proprietary blob.</br>
So I created jmu, A minimalist, expandable, and usable markup language.</br></p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>Well you know <code>sed</code> right?
sed is a <i>powerful</i> stream/text editor,
and a markup language is just a copy/paste tool to transform text to <b>HTML</b>.</p>
<h2>Why sed?</h2>
<p>Just thinking out of the box,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> is a POSIX-compliant tool,
all of its existence is just to copy/paste text and manipulating text,
and it exists on almost all UNIXâ„¢-like systems, so why not?</p>
